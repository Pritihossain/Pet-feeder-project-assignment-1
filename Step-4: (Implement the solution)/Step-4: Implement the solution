Step-4: Implement the solution:
Pseudocode:
Start
1. Wait for the Trigger:
       a. IF (Current Time matches Scheduled Feeding Time)
           OR (Manual Feed Button pressed)  
       b. Proceed to Step 2  
       c. ELSE (Loop back and wait)
2. Check Hopper Level:
       a. IF (Hopper Low)  
       b. Turn ON Red LED, Sound Buzzer, Log "Hopper Low", END.  
       c.  ELSE (Proceed to Step 3)
3. Check for Jam:
       a. IF (Jam Detected)  
       b. Turn ON Red LED, Sound Buzzer, Log "Jam Detected", END.  
       c. ELSE (Proceed to Step 4)
4. Dispense Food:
        a. Activate Motor for calibrated duration (e.g., 1200ms).
5. Verify Food Dispensed:
       a. IF (Food Detected in Bowl OR Bowl Weight increased)  
       b. Proceed to Step 6.  
       c. ELSE (Turn ON Red LED, Sound Buzzer, Log "No Food Dispensed", END)
6. Start Eating Timer:
     a. Begin countdown (e.g., 30 minutes).
7. Check Food Consumption:
     a. IF (Bowl Weight decreased â‰¥ Minimum Threshold OR IR Sensor shows food cleared)  
     b. Turn ON Green LED, Log "Feeding Successful", END.  
     c.  ELSE  (Turn ON Red LED, Sound Buzzer, Log "Food Not Eaten", END)
END
